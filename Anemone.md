# Anemone

Anemone is a simple open source theme manager for the 3ds. Its GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/astronautlevel2/Anemone3DS).

A good place to find 3ds themes is [Theme Plaza](https://themeplaza.art/themes)

[_Themes_](./#downloading-themes) are the themes you see on the Home screen of your 3ds

[_Splashes_](./#downloading-splashes) are the screen you see when booting your 3ds, before getting into the Home menu

## Downloading Themes

This section covers downloading themes, with each subsection covering a different method. QR codes are generally the simplest method, Theme Plaza allows you to download themes without an external device, and manual install avoids using Anemone to download at all by placing the themes on your SD card yourself.

### Using QR codes to download Themes (personally recommended)

The first thing you'll want to do is find a theme you want to use on [Theme Plaza](https://themeplaza.art/themes) on another device, then either hover over it to display its QR code, or click into the theme and hover over the art to display its QR code.

To scan the QR code, simply open the Anemone app on your 3ds (make sure you're connected to the internet on the 3ds), press `R` (right shoulder button), and scan the theme's QR code. The theme will automatically begin to download for you.
After doing this, your theme will appear on Anemone.

To install the theme (use it on your 3ds), look at [installing themes](./#installing-themes)

### Theme Plaza on Anemone

Another option for downloading themes is a built in feature of Anemone where you can browse Theme Plaza directly on the 3ds itself.
You can access this by pressing `X` on the main screen of Anemone, then pressing  `left D-pad`.  REFINE THIS LATER



AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

To install the theme (use it on your 3ds), look at [installing themes](./#installing-themes)

### Manual Theme downloading

If you would rather install a theme manually, you first need to find the theme you want on [Theme Plaza](https://themeplaza.art/themes), click on/in to the theme, then hit `Download`. This will download the `ZIP` folder of the theme to your computer.

To import this to the 3ds, you want to place the downloaded `ZIP` file (without unzipping it) in `SD_CARD_NAME:/Themes`. Create this folder if it does not exist.
From here, insert the SD card in your 3ds, open Anemone, and your theme will be available for you to install.

To install the theme (use it on your 3ds), look at [installing themes](./#installing-themes)

## Previewing Themes

Downloaded themes can easily be previewed natively on your 3ds simply by hovering over them and pressing `Y`. This allows you to see if you like the theme before installing it.

## Installing themes

"Installing" a theme simply means the process of selecting to use a downloaded theme on your 3ds. To access the install menu, you want to press `A` on a theme you want to use, which will bring up a sub menu on the top screen with a list of options
The sections below go over these options more in depth.

**To use these options**, while still holding `A`, select the D-pad option correlating to the install you want to use, then releasing the `A` button.

### Single/Normal themes

Normal themes install a single selected theme without the ability to shuffle them.
`Normal Install` (D-pad ____________) installs the selected theme with its BGM (BackGround Music) enabled

### Shuffle themes

Shuffle themes are themes installed set to shuffle, so that you can see multiple themes periodically without having to install a new one every time. This shuffles every time the Home screen is _refreshed_, not every time it is viewed.

Themes can be queued to be shuffled by pressing B on the themes you want. You can select up to 10. 
`Shuffle Install` (D-pad ____________) installs all queued shuffle themes 

### BGM installs

Installing a theme like this allows you to handpick the BGM you want to have regardless of the theme you use.

`BGM-ony install` (D-pad ____________) only installs the BGM of the selected theme
`No-BGM install` (D-pad ____________) installs the selected theme without its respective BGM

## Uninstalling Themes

------------------

## Downloading Splashes

The splashes screen can be accessed by pressing `L` (the left shoulder button) in Anemone

Follow the same steps as [Downloading Themes](./#downloading-themes), except use [this link to Theme Plaza](https:/themeplaza.art/splashes) to search for splashes instead of themes.

## Previewing Splashes

Previewing Splashes can be done in the same way as themes, simply by pressing `Y` while hovered over the Splash you want to see

## Installing Splashes

On the splashes screen, simply hit `A` to install the Splash you're currently hovered over

## Uninstalling Splashes

## Closing Anemone

You can close Anemone simply by going home and closing the application, however hitting `Start` while inside Anemone guarantees your changes save and apply properly.
