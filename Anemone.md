# Anemone

Anemone is a simple open source theme manager for the 3ds. Its GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/astronautlevel2/Anemone3DS).

A good place to find 3ds themes is [Theme Plaza](https://themeplaza.art/themes)

## Downloading themes

This section covers downloading themes, with each subsection covering a different method. QR codes are generally the simplest method, Theme Plaza allows you to download themes without an external device, and manual install avoids usign Anemone to download at all by placing the themes on your SD card yourself.

## Using QR codes to download themes

The first thing you'll want to do is find a theme you want to use on [Theme Plaza](https://themeplaza.art/themes) on another device, then either hover over it to display its QR code, or click into the theme and hover over the art to display its QR code.

To scan the QR code, simply open the Anemone app on your 3ds (make sure you're connected to the internet on the 3ds), press `R` (right shoulder button), and scan the theme's QR code. The theme will automatically begin to download for you.
After doing this, your theme will appear on Anemone.

To install the theme (use it on your 3ds), look at [installing themes](./#Installing-themes)

## Theme Plaza on Anemone

Another option for downloading themes is a built in feature of Anemone where you can browse Theme Plaza directly on the 3ds itself.
You can access this by pressing `X` on the main screen of Anemone, then pressing  `left D-pad`.  REFINE THIS LATER

## Manual theme downloading

If you would rather install a theme manually, you first need to find the theme you want on [Theme Plaza](https://themeplaza.art/themes), click on/in to the theme, then hit `Download`. This will download the `ZIP` folder of the theme to your computer.

To import this to the 3ds, you want to place the downloaded `ZIP` file (without unzipping it) in `SD_CARD_NAME:/Themes`. Create this folder if it does not exist.
From here, insert the SD card in your 3ds, open Anemone, and your theme will be available for you to install.

## Previewing themes

Downloaded themes can easily be previewed natively on your 3ds simply by hovering over them and pressing `Y`. This allows you to see if you like the theme before installing it.

## Installing themes

"Installing" a theme simply means preparing it to be used after downloading it. To access the install menu, you want to press `A` on a theme you want to use, which will bring up a sub menu on the top screen with a list of options
The sections below go over these options more in depth.

### Single/Normal themes

If you only want to use one theme, all you need to do is hold `A` on a theme that you have downloaded. This will bring up a sub menu on the top screen with instructions. 
`Normal Install` installs the selected theme with BGM (BackGround Music) enabled

### Shuffle themes

`Shuffle themes` are themes installed set to shuffle, so that you can see multiple themes periodically without having to install a new one every time.

Shuffle themes can be queued by pressing B (meaning they will be included in the shuffle queue), and you can select up to 10. 

`Shuffle Install`

### BGM installs

Installing a theme like this allows you to handpick the BGM you want to have regardless of the theme you use.
`BGM-ony install` only installs the BGM of the selected theme
`No-BGM install` installs the selected theme without its respective BGM
