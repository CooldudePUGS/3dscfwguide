This a gudie meant to describe how to use various functions of CFW (Custom FirmWare) features of the 3DS. You can get CFW by folliwng the guide linked [here](https://3ds.hacks.guide)

There is a chance that this has been done 10,000 times before, I just wanted to write this for fun and for friends to use. 

This guide also assumes you've followed the setup guide for CFW entirely, and installed the suggested additional programs (which will be the main focus point of this guide)
