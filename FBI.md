# FBI 

FBI is an open source title manager for the 3ds. Its GitHub repo can be found [here](https://github.com/Steveice10/FBI).

FBI's most common use is install `.cia` formatted files to the 3ds, most of which are games. 
More often than not, users choose to make a `cias` folder on the root of their SD card which they put `.cia` files inside of. 
You can navigate to this folder on the FBI app by simply going in to `SD` on the main menu using the A button, then using the D-pad, finding `cias`, and hitting A.

From here, you can install your apps to your 3ds. You can do this by navigating to the file you want to install, pressing A, then choosing an install option, or by clicking `<current directory>`, which will select that option for all `.cia` files inside the folder.
`Install` simply installs the app to your home screen while preserving the orginal file, while `Install and delete` installs the app to your home screen while deleting the original file to save space. This file isn't neccesary to keep to allow the app to work.

FBI can also install applications via a QR code, which some app creators provide. All you need to do to install via QR code is to select `Remote Install` on the main screen of FBI, hit `Scan QR Code`, scan the QR code, then install the app when prompted.

FBI has more uses than this, however this is what most users will end up using it for.
